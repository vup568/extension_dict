# Agent Teams -- Controls, Display Modes & Task Management

> **Source:** https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams
> **Version captured:** Claude Code v2.1.80 (March 2026)

## Display Modes

- **In-process** (default fallback): all teammates in one terminal. `Shift+Up/Down` to navigate. Works in any terminal.
- **Split panes**: each teammate gets own pane. Requires tmux or iTerm2.

Default is `"auto"` -- uses split panes if already inside a tmux session, otherwise in-process. The `"tmux"` setting enables split-pane mode and auto-detects tmux vs iTerm2.

```json
{ "teammateMode": "in-process" }
```

Per-session override: `claude --teammate-mode in-process`

Split panes NOT supported in: VS Code terminal, Windows Terminal, Ghostty.

**tmux setup:** install via system package manager.
**iTerm2 setup:** install `it2` CLI, enable Python API in iTerm2 > Settings > General > Magic.

## Model Requirements

All Agent Team teammates must run **Opus 4.6** -- this is a hard constraint. Mixed-model teams (e.g., Sonnet for devs, Haiku for testers) are NOT supported within Agent Teams.

For mixed-model workflows, use **subagents** instead (the `Agent` tool supports `model: "haiku" | "sonnet" | "opus"` per spawn).

## Plan Approval

Require teammates to plan before implementing:

```
Spawn an architect teammate to refactor the auth module.
Require plan approval before they make any changes.
```

**Flow:**
1. Teammate works in read-only plan mode
2. Teammate finishes planning -> sends `plan_approval_request` to lead
3. Lead reviews -> approves via `SendMessage(type: "plan_approval_response", approve: true)`
4. If rejected: teammate stays in plan mode, revises based on feedback, resubmits
5. Once approved: teammate exits plan mode, begins implementation

**Influence criteria:** "only approve plans that include test coverage" or "reject plans that modify the database schema"

## Delegate Mode

Restricts lead to coordination-only tools: spawning, messaging, shutting down teammates, and managing tasks. No code editing.

Useful when lead should focus entirely on orchestration -- breaking down work, assigning tasks, synthesizing results.

**Enable:** Press `Shift+Tab` after team creation to cycle into delegate mode.

## Direct Teammate Interaction

- **In-process**: `Shift+Up/Down` select teammate, type to message. `Enter` view session. `Escape` interrupt current turn. `Ctrl+T` toggle task list.
- **Split panes**: click into pane to interact directly. Each teammate has full terminal view.

## Task Assignment & Claiming

Three states: **pending** -> **in_progress** -> **completed**. Tasks can have dependencies -- blocked until dependencies resolve.

- **Lead assigns**: tell lead which task -> which teammate
- **Self-claim**: after finishing, teammate picks next unassigned, unblocked task automatically
- **Auto-unblock**: completing a blocking task automatically unblocks dependents

File locking prevents race conditions on simultaneous claiming.

## Worktree Isolation for Implementation

When spawning developer teammates, use `isolation: "worktree"` on the Agent tool:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "fullstack-developer",
  model: "opus",
  isolation: "worktree",
  run_in_background: true,
  prompt: "Implement auth module..."
)
```

Each dev gets own worktree + branch. No file conflicts during parallel work. Lead merges branches after all devs complete.

**When to use:** Always for cook/implementation templates. Not needed for research/review (read-only).

## Background Spawning

Use `run_in_background: true` on the Agent tool to spawn teammates non-blocking:

- Lead continues orchestration while teammates work
- Teammates message the lead when they complete or block
- Use TaskList after 60s or when a teammate messages completion
- Do not rely on ClaudeKit custom team hook handlers; they are not shipped by default

## Shutdown

```
Ask the researcher teammate to shut down
```

Teammate can approve (exit) or reject with explanation. Teammates finish current request/tool call before shutting down -- can be slow.

## Cleanup

After all teammates shut down, call `TeamDelete` (no parameters). Fails if active teammates still exist.

Removes shared team resources (`~/.claude/teams/` and `~/.claude/tasks/` entries).

## Monitoring

1. Lead creates tasks and spawns teammates (with `run_in_background: true`)
2. Teammates mark tasks with `TaskUpdate` and send concise completion messages
3. Lead checks TaskList after 60s or after each completion message
4. Lead acts on verified task state (spawn tester, shut down, reassign)
5. If a task appears stale, message the owner before changing status

Claude Code exposes platform Agent Teams events, but ClaudeKit does not ship custom handlers for those events by default. Keep orchestration explicit until a live harness validates any hook-based flow.
