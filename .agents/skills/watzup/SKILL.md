# Wrap Up

Create a short, evidence-backed handoff report for the active project, with priority-ranked next steps grounded in plan progress and roadmap state.

This skill handles status and handoff reporting only. It does not implement, edit, commit, checkout, merge, push, or fetch unless the user explicitly requests fresh remote refs.

## Required Scan

Run the scanner first from the project root:

```bash
node .claude/skills/watzup/scripts/watzup-scan.cjs --json
```

Use `--fetch` only when the user asks to refresh remotes before the report:

```bash
node .claude/skills/watzup/scripts/watzup-scan.cjs --json --fetch
```

When developing from this source repository before install, use `node claude/skills/watzup/scripts/watzup-scan.cjs --json` only if `.claude/skills/...` is not present.

Default behavior:
- Scan local branches and remote branch refs.
- Scan registered worktrees.
- Scan unfinished plans from visible worktrees and tracked branch refs.
- Count `- [ ]` / `- [x]` checkboxes in each plan directory (plan.md + phase-*.md) for progress %.
- Scan `docs/*roadmap*.md` and `docs/*milestones*.md` for active milestones.
- Build priority-ranked next steps via composite scoring (see below).
- Do not run network operations.
- Do not change branches or mutate the checkout.

## Priority Ranking

The scanner now emits `nextSteps[]` as objects with `{priority, action, rationale, planId?}`. Ordering reflects a composite score per plan:

- **Status**: `in-progress` (+400) > `in-review` (+300) > `pending` (+150).
- **Workspace alignment**: current worktree (+600), current branch (+400).
- **Provenance**: filesystem source (+80), local ref (+40).
- **Momentum**: plans between 40-90% complete get bumped (close to done). Brand-new plans (<10%) get a small starter bump.

Hygiene steps (dirty working tree, detached HEAD) always rank first. Roadmap milestones fill remaining slots after plan-driven actions.

## Report Format

Keep output brief. Prefer this structure:

1. **Current State** - branch or detached HEAD, dirty/clean, active worktree.
2. **Recent Work** - only the highest-signal branches/worktrees.
3. **In-Flight Plans** - unfinished plans with `X/Y todos · NN% done` annotation.
4. **Roadmaps** - active milestones from `docs/*roadmap*.md`, if any.
5. **Next Steps** - 5 to 6 priority-ranked actions, each with one-line rationale.
6. **Warnings** - scanner failures, stale remote-ref caveat, detached HEAD.

If the scanner fails, say it failed and include the error. Then use minimal read-only fallback commands:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git worktree list --porcelain
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate:iso8601) %(objectname:short) %(subject)' refs/heads refs/remotes
find plans -maxdepth 2 -name plan.md -print
find docs -maxdepth 2 -iname '*roadmap*.md' -print
```

Do not pretend the full scan completed when fallback was used.
